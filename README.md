# Bangalore House Price Prediction: A Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. The dataset utilized for this project was sourced from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

The project encompasses various data science concepts including:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature engineering
- Dimensionality reduction
- One-hot encoding
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- K-fold cross-validation

## Technologies and Tools Used

The implementation of this project relied on the following technologies and tools:

1) **Python**: Primary programming language for project development.
2) **Numpy and Pandas**: Utilized for data cleaning and manipulation.
3) **Matplotlib**: Employed for data visualization.
4) **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)**: Utilized for model building.

## Website Deployment

A web application has been developed using **Streamlit** for the house price prediction. The application is hosted on the Streamlit community cloud and can be accessed via [HomeWatch](https://homewatch.streamlit.app/).

This project serves as a foundational framework for predicting house prices in Bangalore, and future enhancements could involve exploring more advanced machine learning models, incorporating additional features, or utilizing larger datasets for model training.
