# Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project is about predicting house prices in Bangalore. The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

During the model building process, we covered almost all data science concepts such as:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature engineering
- Dimensionality reduction
- One-hot encoding
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- K-fold cross validation

## Technologies and Tools Used

This project was implemented using the following technologies and tools:

1) **Python**: The main programming language used for implementing the project.
2) **Numpy and Pandas**: Used for data cleaning and manipulation.
3) **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization.
4) **Sklearn**: Used for model building.

## Future Work

This project serves as a good starting point for predicting house prices in Bangalore. Future work could involve:

- Developing a website built in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that allows users to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call a **Python Flask server** to retrieve the predicted price.
- Using more advanced machine learning models, incorporating more features, or using a larger dataset for training the models.
